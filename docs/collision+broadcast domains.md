- **collision domain** - network segment where simul data transmissions collide with each other
	- i.e. all devices in segment have to pay attention to msg even if it was not destined for them
	- causes devices to re-transmit msgs one-by-one if collision occured
	- usually happens in wireless networks, but also early Ethernet
	- only happens in half-duplex mode
	- split by router, switch (not split by hub)

- **broadcast domain** - domain in which a broadcast is forwarded
	- split by router (not switch, hub)
	- large broadcast domains cause congestion
