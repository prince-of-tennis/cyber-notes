- cisco 3 layer hierarchical model
	- core
		- high-speed connection backbone
		- *core* switches
	- distribution
		- connects access layer to core layer
		- *distribution* switches
	- access
		- initial connections to end users

- 3-tier network - dedicated hardware for all 3 layers
- 2-tier network - combined hardware for distrib/core, sep for access
- 1-tier network - combined for all 3 layers
