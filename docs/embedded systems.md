- SoC (System on a Chip)
	- small form-factor
		- external int support
		- usually lower power consumptions
		- difficult to upgrade hardware

- FPGA (Field-programmable gate array)
	- integrated circuit configurable after manufacturing
	- common in firewalls, routers

- SCADA/ICS 
	- found where you have industrial equipment
	- distributed control systems
	- require extensive segmentation/security from outside
