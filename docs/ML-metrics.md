## classification
- accuracy - % correct
- precision + recall
	- precision - % of correct among retrieved instances
	- recall - # of correct
		- e.g. if you were searching for dog on google, getting back everything would mean 100% recall since you got everything that was relevant, but very low precision
- F1 score
- note [[confusion matrix]] -> what kind of accuracy are we getting?
## Regression
- mean squared error
- mean absolute error
- R Squared
